# Getting Started with Static Sites

Static sites are making a comeback, and for good reason. They're:
- Fast
- Secure
- Easy to maintain
- Great for SEO

## Why This Approach?

We're using a simple architecture with just the essentials:
1. Markdown for content
2. HTML templates
3. Basic CSS
4. Node.js for building

No complex frameworks, no overhead - just clean, efficient code.
